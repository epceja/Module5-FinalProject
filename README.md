- There are two tables, which do not have foreign keys
    - _Reference_ - directory. Make the link using _code_ (using id is not allowed, as id is tied to the environment-specific base)
    - _UserBelong_ - link users with type (owner, lead, ...) to object (task, project, sprint, ...). FK will be checked manually
